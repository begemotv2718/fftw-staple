SHORT DESCRIPTION

fftw-staple is a simple and relatively fast program to merge two images which
has overlap region. The approximate overlap region is specified on command
line,then the program find exact amount of the shift of one image relative to
the other and blend them together. Currently the overlap region should be in
exactly the same orientation on the both images, which makes this program only
of limited use to stitch panoramas and scans of the pages that do not fully fit
on the scanner bed (because skewing of one image w.r.t the other is very
likely). 

Skew correction is implemented  in the other branch, however, this is without
 clean interface.
